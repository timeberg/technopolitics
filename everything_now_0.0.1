Introduction
	The modern world is defined by its citizens' reliance on internet-enabled cell phones--smartphones. This is particularly, but not exclusively, the case in those societies broadly conceived of as comprising the "Global North" (shortened as 'the North' in this paper)--places such as the United Kingdom (UK), Luxembourg, and New Zealand. The societal and cultural signifcance of these phones has reached such an extent that their use holds relevance in many aspects of life in the North: such indispensable aspects of modern life as unlocking the door to one's flat, taking public transportation, and checking in to a medical appointment are increasingly handled through the use of a smartphone. This raises the question: what hidden or at least underacknowledged aspects are embedded into the design, manufacture, and disposal of smartphones? This is the question I aim to tackle, at least in part, in this paper. 
	The paper's  theoretical framework is an experimental one. Drawing on two vast groups of sources--Latourian actor-network theory (ANT) and critical conceptualizations of the political economy--not in opposition to one another but as complementary resources, this paper presents a conciliatory yet--I claim--insightful approach called 'power-actor-network theory' (PANT). The paper begins with necessary, initial remarks about the implications of combining these two schools of thought ('A. The Power of Power-Actor-Network Theory'). Next, the paper focuses closely on particular design choices made by smartphone manufacturers, including the omissions of a physical keyboard--when, in 2007, the current paradigm of smartphones was launched by Apple, replacing its predecessors and rivals, Finnish Nokia and Canadian Research In Motion (Blackberry)--and the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack, also spearheaded by Apple ('B. Less Is More: Power in Design'). Third, the paper moves to discussing the impact of the complete transfer of phone manufacturing to Global South countries (as with the North, also referred to as 'the South' in this paper) with the definite consequence of boosting the financial viability of technology companies largely based in the North ('C. Not Made in California'). Although the logical next step would be to discuss the use of smartphones next, in the interest of word space, I will leave this 'ghost chapter' for other academics to create; instead, we move in the last part directly to 'the final site of disposal' (Finnish: loppusijoituspaikka): the many, varied--yet invariably Southern--places where we find smartphones at the end of their life cycles. This chapter ('D. Last Stop') discusses the medically discernible, human ramifications of planned obsolescence on the citizens of 'developing countries' (Finnish: kehittyv√§t maat), otherwise here discussed as the South.

A. The Power of Power-Actor-Network Theory
	At the start of this initial, theory-heavy section, I would be remiss to brush over my intentions with the framework I intend to use as the paper's primary explanatory engine. While ANT points certainly to a well-known, well-worn set of scholarship and its thinkers--such as Bruno Latour, Madeleine Akrich, and John Law, among others--I find the direct usefulness of the works of this coalition to be rather limited. But in an effort not to 'throw the baby out with the bathwater,' I want to stress at the same time that there are aspects of this scholarship which ought to be carried into the future, albeit strengthened by a clear understanding of the social scientific relevance of power. There seems to be an outright reluctance on the part of ANT scholars to consider how the theories could actually improve by an explicit inclusion of power. The extent to which people in this tradition strike me as either wilfully or naively ignorant of the existence of power relations within society--also known as a "socio-technical system"--is uncomfortably high.
	What is 'power,' anyway? For this paper, I'm interested in focusing on power in the neoliberal temporal context; power which arises from the growing relevance of corporations in affecting change in societies. Because of this, I cannot go very far without mentioning Karl Marx, whose evocative conceptualization of social life as basically consisting of a "sometimes visible, sometimes hidden" struggle between classes is useful in unpacking the social scaffolding around smartphones. By this 'scaffolding,' I mean specifically the necessary yet unfortunately underexamined aspects of smartphones (coincidentally presented in this paper in a receding order of public attention): design, manufacturing, and disposal. The purpose of this undertaking is to provide much-needed context about smartphones


Conclusion
	Future research papers on the topic of smartphones could
