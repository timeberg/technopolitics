This is the centralized location of my work on The New School's module, GANT 6614 a.k.a. Technopolitics, titled "Everything Now."
The paper proposes a new framework as an alternative to the ANT tradition (PANT), tentatively supplementing the French scholarship with Marx, Kaczynski, and Debord.
The focused topic is smartphones--more specifically, the underacknowledged 'social scaffolding' which surrounds this technology: design, manufacturing, and disposal.
